# IPL-Visualisation-Tableau-Assignment

The final dashboard can be broken down into several categories and sub-categories. The ones which we need to focus on are as follows:

 

1. Match Statistics

A. Toss outcome vs Match outcome (for each Ground/Venue)
B. Biggest wins (by runs and by wicket)
C. Highest totals (across all the seasons)
 

2. Player Statistics

A. Orange Cap contenders (The batsmen who have scored the maximum number of runs in a particular season)
B. Purple Cap contenders (The bowlers who have taken the maximum number of wickets in a particular season)
C. Batsmen who have hit the most number of fours and sixes (per season and overall)

3. Team Statistics

A. Season-wise team performance (wins vs losses)
B. Win %age ( home vs away)
